## Little Blue Book
Little Blue Book is a web app designed to help you manage your monthly budgets and transactions, while also providing an intuitive interface to visualize how much you've spent on each category. This app is my personal project for my portfolio, and I've built it using the MERN stack, learning a lot about full-stack development in the process.

The app is hosted on render.com, and as I'm currently using the free tier, the backend may take a few minutes to deploy when you use it.
