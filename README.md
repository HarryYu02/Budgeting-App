## Little Blue Book - A Full Stack MERN Budgeting App
Little blue book is a small budgeting web app that can help you keep track of your monthly budgets and transactions, and visualize how much you have spent on each category to help you stick to your budget. This app is created as my personal project for my portfolio, it's my first MERN app ever so I learn a lot about full stack developing and the MERN stack in the process.

The backend is hosted on render.com and I only have free tier so it shuts down everytime when it's not active, therefore it might take a few minutes to deploy when you use it.
